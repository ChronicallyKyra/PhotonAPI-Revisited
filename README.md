# PhotonAPI
 An easy to use, photon api, which is designed to make creating photon bots for games like VRChat, a lot easier to the normal user. Examples can be seen in this repository.

# NOTICE
I do not own any of the instantiation and/or registering custom types in ClientExtensions.cs under Examples, full license goes to VRChat because it literally is copy & pasted from an older build of their game. <br />
